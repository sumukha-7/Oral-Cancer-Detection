# Oral-Cancer-Detection

This mini-project was developed as part of my academic coursework at my university. It showcases my skills and knowledge in Deep Learning.

In this DL project, we used a dataset containing OSCC (oral squamous cell carcinoma) cells and applied multiple transfer learning models to predict whether a given sample has OSCC cells in it or not.
